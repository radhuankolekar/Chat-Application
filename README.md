# Chat-Application
The Real-Time Chat Application is a simple yet powerful communication platform built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. It enables multiple users to connect and exchange messages instantly over the web without page refreshes. Each connected user is assigned a unique socket ID, and all messages are broadcasted in real time to every participant. This project demonstrates how WebSocket technology works behind popular chat systems like WhatsApp Web and Slack, providing live, bidirectional communication between client and server.
